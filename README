Optimizations made on index.html to achieve a PageSpeed score of 90+:
- removed render-blocking javascripts from <head> to after <body>
- changed the loading of google analytics js to be async
- added media query for print css to make it non-blocking
- Resized and compressed pizzeria-small.jpg for index.html
- compressed pizzeria.jpg and profilepic.jpg
- Made non-print css inline since the size was small


Optimizations made in views/js/main.js:
- Changed the implementation of changePizzaSizes function to take randomPizzaContainers and newwidth as input parameters. This is to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary/repetitive looping for finding elements and calculating their widths.
