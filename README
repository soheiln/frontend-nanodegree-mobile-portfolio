This file includes the list of optimizations I have done to achieve a PageSpeed score of 90+:
- removed render-blocking javascripts from <head> to after <body>
- changed the loading of google analytics js to be async
- added media query for print css to make it non-blocking
- Resized and compressed pizzeria-small.jpg for index.html
- compressed pizzeria.jpg and profilepic.jpg
